# Network Capture Feature in Zyte API

## What is the Network Capture Feature?

The Network Capture feature in Zyte API is a tool that allows developers to automatically intercept, record, and analyze HTTP requests and responses that occur during web page interactions. 

This feature enables you to:

- Monitor network traffic during browser automation - capturing API calls, AJAX requests, and other HTTP traffic that happens when a page loads or when specific actions (like scrolling) are performed
- Filter requests based on URL patterns - so you can focus only on the endpoints you care about
- Access complete request and response data - including headers, status codes, and the actual response body content 
- Decode and process the captured data programmatically - allowing extraction of structured data from response bodies

This capability is particularly valuable for working with modern websites that load content dynamically (like infinite scroll pages), where important data isn't in the initial HTML but is fetched through API calls as the user interacts with the page - a common challenge in web scraping, testing, and monitoring scenarios.

## Why Network Capture Matters for Developers

### 1. See the Invisible
Peek behind the scenes of complex websites to discover hidden APIs and data flows that power features like infinite scroll, dynamic content loading, and real-time updates.

### 2. Automate Discovery
Find APIs automatically instead of manually hunting through browser dev tools, saving hours of tedious work and enabling systematic documentation of endpoints.

### 3. Work Smarter, Not Harder
Once you discover these APIs, you can often bypass the browser completely and get data directly from the source, making your tools much faster and more efficient.

### 4. Debug Difficult Interactions
See exactly what happens when users scroll, click, or interact with your website, providing visibility into exactly what gets requested and when.
